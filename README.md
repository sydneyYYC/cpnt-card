###Additional Notes About this Card

- The responsiveness on the card when transitioning from wide screen to phone is wack and includes some cutting of the image at certain sizes. Will need to fix later. 

- Date box is not responsive to clicking of whole card - not sure how to fix this as a:hover will not work.
